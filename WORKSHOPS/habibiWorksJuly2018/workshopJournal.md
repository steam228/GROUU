# WORKSHOP HW - Distributed Design Market Platform
#### at Habibi.Works 30/07/2018 to 03/08/2018

1. Introduction to Arduino
a) Electricity + Ohm's Law
Build a Visual Soil Moisture Sensor

b) Connect it to Arduino and gather data;

c) Trigger a reaction to variations on that data.

see WORKSHOP/materials/day1.pdf

##### day 1 (30/07)
----> nice engagement and it seemed like there was the possibility of forming a smaller team in order to preceed with the work.

##### day 2 (31/07)
-----> day 2 was more about figuring out how to adapt the infrastructure to nodeMCU boards instead of the design of the mainSoilProbe which still is not working properly;
The collaboration with the Meteo station group was great.

2. Introduction to GROUU
Build a simple irrigation system that will adapt soil moisture to specific crops by using 3 simple modules:
a) A soil probe: soil moisture (%) and soil temperature (ºC) (it can gather local environmental data - Relative Humidity and Temperature);

b) Control Water routing by building logic set of actions using Node.js;

c) Visualize data on a Dashboard.

see WORKSHOP/materials/day3.pdf

##### day 3 (01/08)
----> The team is formed by me André Rocha, Aryas Ali and Mustafa Eskandari. Also the team setting up the Meteo station.
