#### Modular Open Agriculture

Enabling the implementation of Precision agriculture / Automation in any context or scale of production:
- from indoor hydroponics to traditional agriculture;
- from a balcony vase implementation to a large exploration;
- in an urban or rural context;
These modules can be useful for all, used together, adapted, remixed, distributed...

#### Your collaboration is precious! No onboarding needed, just start designing and developing!

# Modules V1 - ESP12 based version (under dev - design (boards, enclosures), firmware(arduino))

### Types:
- core;
- s modules (wireless sensors);
- a modules (actuator modules);

### Development Goals

- The way the module is powered is not yet fully defined: All should have batteries (3.3V _____ Amps), some should have only this as power source and be periodically charged (induction most probably), and others, can be connected to a power source (solar, network, wind...) for constant charging;
- A power source (ex: solar panel) can be a module on its own and an induction charger can be another module (tbd - to be designed);
- The following code:
```
const String Instalation = "myFarm"; //Where is it?
const String IDCODE = "1"; //number your probe
const String TYPE = "SoilProbe"; //choose type
const String Host = "Grouu" + Instalation + TYPE + IDCODE; //just change if it is not grouu and you're adapting the code for something else
const char * OTA_PASSWORD  = "yourpasswordhere";

```
will allow you to set a hostname (Host) - These are the only parameters you should have to change before injecting the firmware on your board (we should work on an even simpler method);

- This hostname (`const String Host`):
1. will be the name of the network the device generates each time it is not able to connect to any wireless network;
2. Will identify the MQTT addresses being used by that type of device (expl: `HostName/Sensor/Moist1`);

- There shouldn't be a limit for the ammount of modules developed nor used. The scale and context should dictate these options.
- All Explorations, independently from the context or scale should be considered valid data generators;

### Call for Collaboration

It is permanent, develop whatever you want whenever you want!


## soilProbe
![alt text](./images/soil.png)
- The soil probe reads Soil Moisture and Soil Temperature;
- You can add as many as you want in order to measure these in as many points as you wish.

### design
**eagleCAD:**
**Fusion 3D (plastic 3D print Enclosure):**

### code
**Arduino IDE Firmware:**


## waterRouter
![alt text](./images/router.png)
- The water router uses a standart 1 in 4 out electrovalves from a washing machine. You should also decrease the water pressure on the outputs for microirrigation.
- You can use this directly to the network or after a motor (be careful with the pressure in compatibility). You can add as many as you want in the system.

## core
![alt text](./images/core.png)
- Core is the local server. Right now is mostly a test hub were the data from the networked servers is received and processed.
- We are using Node-Red but all collaboration is welcomed!

### design
Right now we are using a **standard Raspberry case.**

### code
**configure and install:**

#### configuring Raspberry Pi zero W as server

1. configuring the Pi
https://core-electronics.com.au/tutorials/raspberry-pi-zerow-headless-wifi-setup.html

2. Accessing through ssh on mac or linux terminal
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/unix.md

3. upgrade Node-Red and Node.js
- open terminal;
- commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
bash <(curl -sL https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/raspbian-deb-package/master/resources/update-nodejs-and-nodered)
sudo systemctl enable nodered.service
```
- Connect to Raspberry Pi Node-red console throught your browser be accessing ```http://"raspipaddress":1880```

- Install Mosquitto MQTT broker
```sudo apt-get install Mosquitto```

# Archived on this REPO You'll also find:

## mainSoilProbe REV0 - Developed at the Habibi Works (Ioannina, Greece) CultiMake Workshop - P2PLab - Archived
# ![alt text](./images/soilProbeHabibi.jpg)

### design
**eagleCAD:**
- A provisional board (not working!!) is on [/BOARDS/soilProbe/Archive](/BOARDS/soilProbe/Archive);
- For this example a nodeMCU dev board was used and tested at the workshop (see Habibi.Works [Workshop Journal](WORKSHOP/habibiWorksJuly2018/workshopJournal.md))
**enclosure:** A standard plastic box was used for demo purposes.

*This board includes:*
- 1 x 4 male header for DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- 1 x 3 male header for DS18B20 (encapsulated version for Soil Temperature);
- 2 x 2 male header connections for Moisture 10k with Two probes;
- 1 led (no usage yet, mostly for debug purposes);
- 1 ftdi set headers;
- 1 voltage converter 12V - 3,3V;
- 1 x 2 screw headers to add solar panel + battery (maybe connect solar battery pack now).
